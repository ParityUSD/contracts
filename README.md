## Re-compiling Artifacts

To recompile the CashScript Artifacts after making contract changes run

```bash
pnpm compile
```

This command generates the CashScript artifacts from the contracts source files.
The artifacts are generates as TS files to the `artifacts` folder.

Re-compiling artifacts from the same contracts source code will result in identical artifacts except for the `updatedAt` timestamp.
Changing comments in the contract source code changes the `source`, `sourceMap` and `requires` in the compiled output.

### Compiled Contract sizes

To see the compiled output sizes for the different contracts you can modify the compilation command like the following:

```ts
    const command = `cashc "${contractFile}" --size --opcount --output "${outputPath}" --format ts`;
```

Similarly, you could change the artifact output file format to `json`.

## Contract Tests

There is a a dedicated repo `parity_testing_suite` for a Parity Contract tests, the transaction building tests are in the `parity_library` repo.
